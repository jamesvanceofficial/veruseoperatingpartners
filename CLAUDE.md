# VERUS OS (COMPASS)

Internal command center for **VERUS Operating Company** — NOT the same
project as the existing `verus-compass`/`oil-oasis` app
(`/root/frank-dev/oil-oasis`), which serves VERUS Energy Partners (a
different VERUS business, oil & gas). Never touch that project from here.

Operating flow this product exists to run: Lead → Discovery → Business
Assessment → Enterprise Score → Build Recommendation → Proposal → Build
Package → Client Onboarding → Projects → Tasks → Meetings → KPIs → Support
Subscription → Retention/Upsell.

## Scope rule

**Never build anything not explicitly requested.** This product is built in
stages. If a feature isn't in the current stage's instructions, it doesn't
get built yet — no placeholder screens for future stages beyond an honest
empty shell if one was explicitly asked for, no speculative schema, no
"while I'm in here" additions.

## Standing rules

- Never use Playwright, Puppeteer, headless browsers, or screenshots to
  verify work. Verification is limited to: `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run build`, `curl` for status codes, reading files, and direct
  database queries. James does the visual checking.
- No background agents. Work in the foreground so failures surface
  immediately.
- Do not install browser-testing packages.

## Naming / hosting (decided — do not deviate)

- Folder: `/opt/verus-os`
- Container: `verus-os`
- Port: `3009` (host) → `3000` (container)
- Domain: `verusoperatingpartners.com`, with `www` redirecting (301) to the
  bare domain
- ONE Next.js app serves BOTH the public marketing site (at `/`, no auth)
  AND COMPASS (behind `/login`)
- Product name shown inside the authenticated app: **COMPASS**
- Traefik routing is a FILE-PROVIDER route at
  `/docker/traefik/dynamic/verus-os.yml` — NOT docker labels. Docker-label
  auto-discovery has previously failed silently for a new container on this
  VPS's Traefik instance (root cause never found on a prior project); this
  file-provider pattern is the proven-working one. Deploy with
  `bash deploy.sh` (which just runs `docker compose up -d --build`).

## Public / private routing split

- `src/app/page.tsx` — public landing page, no auth, at `/`.
- `src/proxy.ts` (Next 16 renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts`, same
  semantics) gates everything else: unauthenticated requests to any
  non-public path redirect to `/login?next=<path>`. Public paths: `/`,
  `/login`, `/reset-password`, `/update-password`.
- Everything under the `(app)` route group requires a session (enforced
  again at the layout level via `redirect()` as defense in depth, not just
  the proxy).

## Design tokens

CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css` — the single source of truth for the
brand palette, never hardcode a hex value in a component:

```
--navy: #071526;      --navy-2: #0d2238;    --black: #02060d;
--gold: #d4af37;      --gold-light: #f1d27a; --cream: #f7f5ef;
--muted: #a9b4c2;     --green: #4fb27a;     --yellow: #d6b650;
--red: #d35d5d;
```

Dark executive/PE-dashboard feel: glassmorphism (`.glass-panel` /
`.glass-panel-strong` utility classes), soft radial gradients, tight
spacing, restrained glow (`.glow-gold-hover`, `.glow-gold-focus`). Every
screen builds from `src/shared/ui/*` primitives (Card, Table, Button,
FormField/Input/Select, Badge, EmptyState, PageShell, AppShell, BrandMark)
— never a one-off styled div. No stock SaaS blue, no cartoon icons.

## Role model

Four roles (`src/shared/roles.ts`): `verus_admin`, `verus_staff`,
`client_owner`, `client_user`.

- `verus_admin`/`verus_staff` see everything — not scoped to a single org.
- `client_owner`/`client_user` are scoped to exactly one `org_id` (set on
  their `profiles` row) and must NEVER see another org's data. Every table
  that holds org-scoped data gets an `org_id` column and an RLS policy
  using the `fn_is_verus_staff()` / `fn_my_org_id()` helpers from migration
  `0001` — copy that pattern for every new table, never a bespoke
  predicate.
- Enforce role checks server-side (API routes / Server Components), never
  in the client only — see `src/app/api/settings/brand-logo/route.ts` for
  the pattern (get session → look up `profiles.role` → reject before doing
  anything with the admin/secret-key client).

## Migrations rule

**Every schema change lands as a numbered SQL file under
`supabase/migrations/` first, additive only (never drop/rename a column in
place).** Migrations are then run directly against `DATABASE_URL` (present
in `.env.local`, gitignored) — the file is still the source of truth and
must exist and be committed before (or in the same change as) running it.
This project has the automatic-RLS event trigger enabled — every new table
starts with RLS ON and returns nothing until you write an explicit policy
for it. Never ship a table without one.

The app must degrade gracefully when a migration hasn't been run yet
(`relation does not exist`, Postgres error code `42P01`) — see
`src/shared/session.ts`'s `getMyProfile()` for the pattern: return a typed
"not configured" result, never let a missing table crash a page.

## Environment variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — read
  ONLY via static `process.env.X` member access in
  `src/shared/supabase/env.ts` (never a dynamic `process.env[name]` lookup
  — that exact pattern silently broke login on a prior project because
  Next.js can only inline `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars into the browser bundle for
  a statically-analyzable expression).
- `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` — server-only, used by `src/shared/supabase/admin.ts`
  (the full-access client). Never import `admin.ts` from a `"use client"`
  file, never send this key to the browser.
- Build-time: `docker-compose.yml` passes the two `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars as
  Docker build ARGs (baked into the client bundle at `npm run build` time,
  standard Next.js requirement) via a plain `.env` file at the project root
  (compose's own variable-substitution file — separate from `.env.local`,
  which is what the running container loads via `env_file:`). Both are
  gitignored; never commit either, never echo their contents.

## Database tables (update this list every time a migration adds one)

- `organizations` — id, name, created_at ONLY. Full schema comes in a
  later stage — do not add columns speculatively.
- `profiles` — id (= `auth.users.id`), full_name, email, role, org_id,
  created_at. `client_owner`/`client_user` require a non-null `org_id`
  (enforced by a check constraint).
- `app_settings` — singleton row (`id = 1`), `logo_url`, `updated_at`.
  Publicly readable (needed for the login page's pre-auth branding) —
  writes go through `/api/settings/brand-logo` only.
- Storage bucket `brand` (public) — the one working Settings feature this
  stage: brand logo upload, staff-only write.

## Known stage-1 limitation

Sidebar nav (`src/shared/nav.ts`) is currently the same flat list for every
authenticated role — Stage 1 didn't ask for per-role nav filtering. If a
future stage needs it, add it deliberately; don't assume it's already
there.
